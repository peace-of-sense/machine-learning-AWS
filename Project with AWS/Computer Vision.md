# Computer Vision

Computer vision first started in 1960s. Since its inception, it has been an interdisciplinary field. Modern day computer vision uses neural networks, these networks can quickly be trained with millions of images and produce highly accurate predictions.

Early computer vision needed hand annotated images to successfully train a model. It was a tedious and time consuming process.

Modern day CV uses three main component of neural network,

1. **Input layer**: This layer receives data during training and when inference is performed after the model has been trained.
2. **Hidden Layer**: This layer finds important features in the input data that have predictive power based on the labels provided during training.
3. **Output Layer**: This layer generates the output or prediction of your model.

Modern day CV uses Convolution Neural Networks or CNN. These NN uses hidden layers to extract different information from about the images. This process is called **feature extraction**. These models can be trained much faster on millions of images and generate a better prediction than earlier models.

## Application

Computer vision (CV) has many real-world applications. 

* **Image classification** is the most common application of computer vision in use today. Image classification can be used to answer questions like *What's in this image?* This type of task has applications in *text detection* or *optical character recognition (OCR)* and *content moderation*.
* **Object detection** is closely related to image classification, but it allows users to gather more granular detail about an image. For example, rather than just knowing whether an object is present in an image, a user might want to know if there are *multiple instances of the same object* present in an image, or if *objects from different classes* appear in the same image.
* **Semantic segmentation** is another common application of computer vision that takes a pixel-by-pixel approach. Instead of just identifying whether an object is present or not, it tries to identify down the pixel level which part of the image is part of the object.
* **Activity recognition** is an application of computer vision that is based around videos rather than just images. Video has the added dimension of time and, therefore, models are able to detect changes that occur over time.

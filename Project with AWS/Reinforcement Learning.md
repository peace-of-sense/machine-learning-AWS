# Reinforcement Learning

In *reinforcement learning* (RL), an *agent* is trained to achieve a goal based on the feedback it receives as it interacts with an *environment*. It collects a number as a *reward* for each *action* it takes. Actions that help the agent achieve its goal are incentivized with higher numbers. Unhelpful actions result in a low reward or no reward.

With a learning objective of **maximizing total cumulative reward**, over time, the agent learns, through trial and error, to map gainful actions to situations. The better trained the agent, the more efficiently it chooses actions that accomplish its goal.

- **Agent:** The piece of software you are training is called an agent. It makes decisions in an environment to reach a goal.
- **Environment:** The environment is the surrounding area with which the agent interacts.
- **Reward:** Feedback is given to an agent for each action it takes in a given state. This feedback is a numerical reward.
- **Action:** For every state, an agent needs to take an action toward achieving its goal.

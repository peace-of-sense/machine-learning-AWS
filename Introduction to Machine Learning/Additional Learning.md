- Want to learn more about how software and application come together? Reading through this entry about the [software development process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development) from Wikipedia can help.

- The [AWS Machine Learning blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/) is a great resource for learning more about projects in machine learning.

- You can use Amazon SageMaker [to calculate new stats in Major League Baseball](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/calculating-new-stats-in-major-league-baseball-with-amazon-sagemaker/).

- You can also find an article on [Flagging suspicious healthcare claims with Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/flagging-suspicious-healthcare-claims-with-amazon-sagemaker/) on the AWS Machine Learning blog.

- What[ kinds of questions and problems](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/machine-learning-problems-in-amazon-machine-learning.html) are good for machine learning?

- In machine learning, you use several statistical-based tools to better understand your data. The `sklearn` library has many examples and tutorials, such as this example demonstrating [outlier detection on a real dataset](https://sklearn.org/auto_examples/applications/plot_outlier_detection_housing.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-outlier-detection-housing-py).

- The Wikipedia entry on the [bias-variance ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias–variance_tradeoff)trade-off can help you understand more about this common machine learning concept.

- In this [AWS Machine Learning blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-a-model-to-predict-the-impact-of-weather-on-urban-air-quality-using-amazon-sagemaker/), you can see how to train a machine-learning algorithm to predict the impact of weather on air quality using Amazon SageMaker.

- The tools used for model evaluation are often tailored to a specific use case, so it's difficult to generalize rules for choosing them. The following articles provide use cases and examples of specific metrics in use.

  1. [This healthcare-based example](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/create-a-model-for-predicting-orthopedic-pathology-using-amazon-sagemaker/), which automates the prediction of spinal pathology conditions, demonstrates how important it is to avoid false positive and false negative predictions using the tree-based `xgboost` model.
  2. The popular [open-source library `sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html) provides information about common metrics and how to use them.
  3. [This entry from the AWS Machine Learning blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/making-accurate-energy-consumption-predictions-with-amazon-forecast/) demonstrates the importance of choosing the correct model evaluation metrics for making accurate energy consumption estimates using Amazon Forecast.

- The [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/) blog is a fantastic resource for learning more about machine learning. The following example blog posts dive deeper into training regression-based machine learning models.

  1. [How to Develop Ridge Regression Models in Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/ridge-regression-with-python/) offers another approach to solving the problem in the example from this lesson.

  2. Regression is a popular machine learning task, and you can use [several different model evaluation metrics](https://machinelearningmastery.com/regression-metrics-for-machine-learning/) with it.

- The [How to Develop a Deep Learning Bag-of-Words Model for Sentiment Analysis (Text Classification)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/deep-learning-bag-of-words-model-sentiment-analysis/) blog post provides an example using a bag of words–based approach pair with a deep learning model.
- As you continue your machine learning journey, you will start to recognize problems that are excellent candidates for machine learning.

* The [AWS Machine Learning Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/) is a great resource for finding more examples of machine learning projects.
  1.  In the [Protecting people from hazardous areas through virtual boundaries with Computer Vision](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/protecting-people-through-virtual-boundaries-computer-vision/) blog post, you can see a more detailed example of the deep learning process described in this lesson.

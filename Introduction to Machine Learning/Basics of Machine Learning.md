# Basics of Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is the application of the Artificial Intelligence that make computer to learn automatically without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of ML

* Supervised learning
* Un-supervised learning
* Reinforced learning

### Supervised learning

In supervised learning, algorithm is trained by providing a collection of datasets with defined rows and columns.

### Unsupervised learning

There are no labeled dataset training. The ml algorithm tried to find patterns underlying in the provided dataset.

### Reinforced learning

In this type, the algorithm figures out which step to take to provide making appealing result.

## Components of Machine Learning

1. Data- It can be unprocessed text, images, audio, video, fact, value, sound etc., which can be interpreted & analyzed.
2. Algorithm- Algorithm in ml is a procedure that is run on data to create a machine learning model.
3. Model- Model is a file that has been trained using data to find specific type of patterns.
4. Model Inference- Model inference is when the trained model is used to generate predictions.

### **Additional** 

- **Bag of words**: A technique used to extract features from the text. It counts how many times a word appears in a document (corpus), and then transforms that information into a dataset.
- **Data vectorization**: A process that converts non-numeric data into a numerical format so that it can be used by a machine learning model.
- **Silhouette coefficient**: A score from -1 to 1 describing the clusters found during modeling. A score near zero indicates overlapping clusters, and scores less than zero indicate data points assigned to incorrect clusters. A score approaching 1 indicates successful identification of discrete non-overlapping clusters.
- **Stop words**: A list of words removed by natural language processing tools when building your dataset. There is no single universal list of stop words used by all-natural language processing tools.
